Optimizing Docker Images with Multi-Stage Builds Description: Enhanced Docker image efficiency and security using Multi-Stage Builds.

Docker has revolutionized the way we build, ship, and deploy applications. One of Docker's powerful features that significantly enhances the development and deployment pipeline is Multi-Stage Builds. 
Here we will deep dives into the concept of Docker Multi-Stage Builds, exploring how they optimize the containerization process, improve efficiency, and streamline the delivery of applications.

What Are Multi-Stage Builds?

Multi-Stage Builds allow you to split your Dockerfile into multiple parts. This means you can break down the steps in building a Docker image into several stages. By doing so, you can create images that include only the dependencies necessary for the final application, reducing both time and space.

Key Benefits of Multi-Stage Builds

1. Smaller Image Size: Multi-Stage Builds help remove unnecessary parts from the final image. Developers can use different stages for building and packaging the application, ensuring that only essential components are included. This results in smaller images, saving storage space and making image downloads faster.

2. Better Security: By breaking down the build process into separate stages, Multi-Stage Builds enhance security. The final production image includes only the runtime dependencies, reducing potential vulnerabilities from development and build-time tools. This separation improves the overall security of containerized applications.

3. Faster Build Times: Multi-Stage Builds can speed up the build process significantly. Each stage can be tailored for a specific task, avoiding unnecessary steps in later stages. This reduces the time needed to create the image and allows for quicker development iterations.

4. Easier CI/CD Pipelines: Using Multi-Stage Builds in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines makes the workflow simpler. By creating specialized stages for testing, building, and packaging, developers can ensure a smooth and efficient deployment process from development to production.

The Main Purpose of Choosing a Go-Based Application

The main purpose of choosing a Go-based application to demonstrate this example is that Go is a statically-typed programming language that does not require a runtime in the traditional sense. Unlike dynamically-typed languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, which rely on a runtime environment to execute their code, Go compiles directly to machine code, which can then be executed directly by the operating system.

So the real advantage of multi-stage Docker builds and distroless images can be understood with a drastic decrease in the image size.

Rich Base Image

A rich base image is a base image that has all the dependencies required for your application. While this can simplify the development process by providing a comprehensive environment, it often results in larger image sizes. This approach is useful during the development phase but may not be ideal for production due to the increased size and potential security vulnerabilities.

Distroless Images

Distroless images are essentially very minimalistic images that contain hardly any packages. If you choose a Python distroless image, it will only have the Python runtime. Besides reducing your container image size, distroless images offer the highest security by minimizing the attack surface.

Execute a Calculator App as a Docker Container

Dockerfile without Multi-Stage Build:

###########################################
# BASE IMAGE
###########################################

FROM ubuntu

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y golang-go

ENV GO111MODULE=off

COPY . .

RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o /app .

ENTRYPOINT ["/app"]

Dockerfile with Multi-Stage Build:

###########################################
# BASE IMAGE
###########################################

FROM ubuntu AS build

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y golang-go

ENV GO111MODULE=off

COPY . .

RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o /app .

############################################
# HERE STARTS THE MAGIC OF MULTI STAGE BUILD
############################################

FROM scratch

# Copy the compiled binary from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app /app

# Set the entrypoint for the container to run the binary
ENTRYPOINT ["/app"]

In this example, the first stage installs dependencies, copies source code, and builds the application. The second stage copies only the necessary artifacts and installs production dependencies, resulting in a smaller and more secure final image.

Comparing Image Sizes

After building both Dockerfiles, you can compare the image sizes using the docker images command.

Output:

$ docker images

REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
calculator-app      latest              abcdef123456        2 minutes ago       1.83MB
calculator-app      traditional         123456abcdef        3 minutes ago       861MB

As shown, the multi-stage build image (calculator-app:latest) is significantly smaller compared to the traditional build image (calculator-app:traditional). This is because only the artifacts needed for runtime are included in the final stage.

Conclusion

Docker Multi-Stage Builds provide a powerful mechanism for optimizing containerized workflows, offering benefits such as reduced image size, enhanced security, faster builds, and simplified CI/CD pipelines. By adopting this approach, developers can strike a balance between efficient resource utilization and a streamlined application deployment process, ultimately delivering more robust and scalable containerized solutions.

Optimizing your Docker images is a game-changer in the fast-paced world of containerization. Embrace Multi-Stage Builds to create smaller, more secure, and faster-to-deploy Docker images.
